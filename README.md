# RPI-Slider-GUI

# Change the Light Intensity Using GUI
GUIs can be used for more complex tasks such as taking user input and performing a certain
task on an embedded system according to the user input.

# Hardware Required
* Raspberry Pi
* Keyboard and mouse
* LEDs
* Breadboard and jumper wires

# Software Required
* Raspberry Pi with OS installed

# Pre-requisites
* Complete tasks 4.1P and 5.1P

# Task Objective
In this task, you will develop a more complex GUI interface. The aim is to build a GUI interface
on the Raspberry Pi. The GUI should include three slider widgets. The slider will determine
the intensity of the LED using PWM.
Use the learning you have achieved and the experience of task 5.1P to complete this task.
You can use the same programming language and GUI package as 5.2C.
